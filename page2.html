            <h2>Your Own Voice Poetry</h2>
            <p>This is your own voice encryption station. You can describe something at random in front of a microphone and no one will know about it but you. Eventually it will become a beautiful but accidental picture. Maybe years from now, you won't remember what things you said, and maybe it won't matter anymore. But that one-of-a-kind image will still be there, a reminder of the uniqueness of each person.</p>

            <h2>Language Fungi</h2>
            <p>Fungus is a very powerful organism that can silently parasitise inside the body of some beings and gradually replace the body. Language is the killing of people and things. Symbols form man's first situation, and something else replaces him. This would be the earliest event of alienation that we experienced. These symbols silently kill the existence of the subject. Just like these fungi, gradually replacing and covering the real being.</p>
